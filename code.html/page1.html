        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Carbon emissions in the world and in India </h1><br>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Carbon emissions, which are the primary drivers of global climate change, originate predominantly from the combustion of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. These fuels power industries, propel transportation, and provide energy for various human activities. As these fuels burn, they release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and leading to a rise in global temperatures. In the context of India, similar sources of emissions prevail, with the heavy use of coal for energy production, a rapidly expanding transportation sector, and ongoing industrialization contributing to the country's carbon footprint. This issue is compounded by deforestation and changes in land use. Addressing these emissions is crucial for curbing the impacts of climate change and necessitates a shift towards renewable energy sources, enhanced energy efficiency, and sustainable land management practices.</p>

                <h1>Carbon footprint due to vehicles in India: </h1>
                <p>The surge in vehicle numbers in India due to urbanization, economic growth, and improved living standards leads to increased carbon emissions from fossil fuel use. This elevates the country's carbon footprint and contributes to global climate change. While this rise in vehicles poses challenges like congestion and pollution, efforts to promote electric vehicles and enhance public transportation systems aim to mitigate these issues while reducing India's carbon emissions and advancing sustainability goals</p>

            <h1>MUMBAI</h1>
            
            <p>Mumbai's role as a financial and entertainment hub has spurred swift urban expansion and a surge in vehicles, leading to significant carbon emissions. Increased prosperity and mobility demands have fueled private vehicle ownership, causing congestion and a higher carbon footprint. Notably, during the pandemic, around 3 lakh two-wheelers and 1.4 lakh cars were added to the vehicle count. The bike population grew from 23 lakh in February 2020 to 26 lakh in 2022, and the car population increased from 10.7 lakh to over 12 lakh. To meet this challenge, Mumbai is focusing on improving public transportation, promoting electric vehicle adoption, efficient traffic management, and urban planning that reduces private vehicle reliance. These initiatives aim to mitigate Mumbai's carbon impact while enhancing overall sustainability.</p>

            <p> As vehicle ownership climbs, so does the city's carbon footprint due to higher emissions from traffic. To address this, Pune is enhancing public transport, enforcing stricter emission standards, and adopting sustainable urban planning to cut carbon emissions and promote an eco-friendly environment. The city's vehicle landscape is dominated by motorcycles, with 3,223,135 bikes, followed by 753,222 cars. Notably, the Pune RTO registered a decade-high of 51,066 cars during the last fiscal year (2021-22) due to post-Covid-19 travel safety concerns. The number of auto-rickshaws and taxis has also risen, with 88,674 autos and 36,946 taxis serving passengers across the city.</p>

            <p>Rapid urbanization and tech-driven growth have surged vehicle ownership in Bangalore, elevating its carbon footprint. More economic opportunities and disposable incomes have made cars accessible, intensifying congestion and carbon emissions. Bus numbers slightly rose from 6,064 (2011-12) to 6,763 (2022), and vehicles jumped from 50 lakh to 1 crore. To counter this, the city focuses on boosting public transit and electric vehicle adoption to curb emissions.</p>

            <p>The prevalence of private vehicles and insufficient public transportation options have worsened emissions. As of March 31, 2021, Delhi had 122.53 lakh motor vehicles on its roads, marking a 3.03 percent growth from the previous year, with cars and jeeps accounting for 28 percent and two-wheelers for 67 percent of the total registered vehicles. To address this critical concern, Delhi is actively promoting electric vehicle adoption, enhancing public transportation networks, imposing stringent emission standards, and implementing pollution control measures. These endeavors are geared towards reducing the city's carbon footprint and enhancing air quality.</p>
